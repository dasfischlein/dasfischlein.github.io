I point out that the intuitions supporting Weak Supplementation also support a stronger principle, Weak Supplementation of Pluralities, and that the principle can only do the work demanded by our intuitions when formulated in terms of a notion of fusion that cannot be defined merely in terms of mereological properties and relations, logic, and a membership relation.

The arguments say that if shape is intrinsic and the location relation is fundamental, then we cannot explain the necessary correlation between an object’s shape and the shape of its location. And the Humean principle rules out such unexplained necessary connections. I reject this application of the Humean principle. Sometimes there are truths about what it means to stand in a given relation, even when that relation has no analysis. And these truths entail that certain features are had by the relata of the relation. Lacking an explanation for these sorts of truths is not problematic.

In fact, positing even the mere conceivability of multilocation will require the denial of the analyticity of these principles.  Some have claimed that we ought to relativise parthood,  to one region or to two.  But if we replace our mereological axioms  with region-relativised counterparts, we cannot capture the intuitions that supported the original axioms. I argue the only adequate solution  is to restrict multilocation to a domain outside the scope of the rules we intuitively take to govern the parthood relation.

  <p align="left"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>(<em>Religious Studies</em>, Forthcoming) According to Simple Trinitarianism, God is mereologically simple (He has no parts distinct from Himself), and the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not identified with any entities in our ontology. In this way, the Simple Trinitarian is able to avoid conflating Persons or multiplying Gods, and does not have to identify the Persons with minor entities or entities partly disjoint from God, such as modes, events, or properties. However, in order to maintain that Trinitarian sentences are nonetheless true, our Simple Trinitarian will need a non-standard semantics. I explore just one option for this, which involves taking &quot;the Father&quot;, &quot;the Son&quot;, and &quot;the Holy Spirit&quot; to be empty names. By adopting a positive, Free Logic, we can take these names to make semantic contributions and play roles in true sentences, while blocking problematic inferences such as the one &quot;The Father is God and the Son is God, and the Father is distinct from the Son&quot; to &quot;There are at least two Gods&quot;.</b></font></b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>It is common to think that it’s possible for entities to spatially coincide in multiple ways: with overcrowding (as with two bosons located in the same region, not made of anything in common), and without overcrowding (as with a statue and a lump of clay). Typically, we can distinguish between these  by claiming that uncrowded spatial overlap involves a sharing of parts, and crowded spatial overlap does not. However, if we think that mereologically unusual entities, such as extended simples or some kinds of gunk, can also spatially overlap in crowded and uncrowded ways,  we lose the ability to distinguish between those varieties of spatial overlap via appeal to shared parts. Thus, we should either reject the possibilities that generated this difficulty, or we must look for an alternative explanation of these varieties of spatial overlap.</b></font></b><br />

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>I present and motivate a new form of plenitude. According to Decompositional Plenitude, there is some object, x, that fuses some ys and yet has some part that is disjoint from each of the ys. This view opens new options for the sort of metaphysics we may endorse in a wide range of areas. For instance, it provides us with new responses to the Problem of the Many and to the Problem of Change (across time and across space), it helps us solve Russell’s Paradox of Propositions and a related paradox applied to hylomorphism, and it allows us to describe cases we may posit if we accept liberalism about how things can decompose. More generally, it allows us to avoid having to select just one way things decompose among multiple, merely arbitrarily differing, at least partly disjoint alternatives. And even more strikingly, it allows us to posit multiple, at least partly disjoint decompositions in cases where those decompositions differ substantively, each capturing something important about the world. Finally, I argue that we can endorse Decompositional Plenitude with minimal cost if we also endorse a fusion-first mereology.</b></font></b></p>

          <blockquote>
            <p align="left"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>Trenton Merricks has argued that Presentism and Existential Four-Dimensionalism are incompatible. This raises a problem for any Presentist who wishes to endorse the completely natural claim that some entities, like events, persist four-dimensionally. Objectors have claimed that Merricks’ incompatibility relies on implausible additional assumptions. I will argue, to the contrary, that very minimal mereological assumptions, namely the principle of Weak Supplementation of Pluralities and a principle about fusion, will each be sufficient to do this work in producing an incompatibility of Presentism and Existential Four-Dimensionalism. Finally, I will describe the sorts of tensed mereological principles a Presentist may attempt to invoke in order to avoid this incompatibility.</b></font></b><br />

          <blockquote>
            <p align="left"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>Jeffrey Brower has presented an Aristotelian account of change that has a structure similar to a temporal parts account,  but which is friendly to Three-Dimensionalists. On this solution, temporary objects have temporary properties and persisting objects as parts, and persisting objects (in some sense) derive temporary properties from the temporary objects they are successively parts of. We  raise a dilemma for this view: either the solution cannot account for facts about how objects change in parts over time, or it requires rejecting the claim that, for any object, if it has a part present at a region, then the object is partly present at the region. We explore how theorists who endorse a hylomorphic view of material objects may be able to reject some common connections between parts and places, but we argue that they will not have plausible grounds to reject the principle about partial location when applied to material objects.</b></font></b></p>

            <p align="left"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>There’s an intuitive distinction between two types of desires:  conditional (desires for things such that we want to get them only as long as we’ll still want them when we get them) and unconditional (desires for things that we want to get regardless of how we’ll feel about them later).  Derek Parfit has suggested that we interpret conditional desires as desires involving certain conditionals – that is, that we interpret them as being implicitly conditional upon their own persistence.  While this account seems intuitive, I argue that it is incorrect.   I examine several ways of cashing out conditional desires in terms of conditionals, and show problems with each.   I then  present a trilemma against this way of interpreting conditional desires, based on problems independent of those already mentioned.  Finally, I conclude by noting that the problems I raise apply to a wide variety of accounts, not just those involving conditionals, which leaves us with an interesting puzzle:  we have an intuitive, easily graspable distinction, and difficulty in accounting for it.</b></font></b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>I am currently in the process of drafting a book-length manuscript that brings together many of the central themes in my papers, and that allows me to present and argue for my positive views and draw out the implications of my arguments.  My central aim in the book is to argue for the thesis that, necessarily, any objects that persist across time or space have smaller parts in each of the smaller regions they fill.   The structure of the book is as follows:</b></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>I begin with stage-setting, with a focus on what our aims should be in presenting theories of parthood and location. In particular, I  address the largely neglected topic of what explanatory role these theories should be playing.  I note that  philosophers often ignore cases that strike them as impossible, when in fact they should look to their theories to explain why these things can’t obtain.  I use this methodology to argue for an amendment to the canonical theory of parthood.</b></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>Once I have set out my methodology and a background of theories of parthood and location, I begin arguing for my moderate metaphysical views.  I argue using strange cases I’ve built up from possibilities many philosophers accept.  I present worries using cases involving  multilocation, cases using extended simple objects, cases involving colocation, and cases involving infinitely divisible objects.   I explore how we might revise our theories of parthood and location in light of these cases, but claim that it is less costly to keep our theories unaltered and reject the possibility of these strange cases. Following my own earlier advice, I note that it is not enough to claim the cases are impossible; we must also explain why they are impossible.  I sketch some alternatives for explanation.</b></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>Once we reject the possibilities that led to these cases, we are left with the theory of persistence through time and space that I prefer.  I conclude my manuscript by examining two implications of this view:  first, I argue that it is incompatible with Three-Dimensionalism.  This involves a foray into examining alternate formulations of the central competing views of persistence through time.</b></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>Next, I look at the implications for the topic of how to understand debates about parthood, location, and persistence.  Some philosophers think that these metaphysical debates are illusory; when people debate about persistence, for instance, and think they’re disagreeing about something substantive, they’re really just describing the same thing in two different ways.  On one version of this view, there’s just matter spread across spacetime, and we’re differing in how we use language to divide it up.  But: the <font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>assumption about how matter relates to spacetime</b></font> that these metaphysical deflationists are making is itself a significant metaphysical   claim!  And that claim must be argued for.  My work can be seen as friendly to these metaphysical deflationists, then, because I begin by assuming their opponent’s position (in taking these debates seriously), and end up arguing for a conclusion that is required for this version of the view that the disagreements are not substantive.  (Though I do not endorse metaphysical deflationism myself.)</b></font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Garamond" color="#822C14"><b>Thus, though the cases I consider are strange, I argue for conclusions that are modest and intuitive.  And though my work consists of unapologetically and wholeheartedly doing central Metaphysics, my hope is that it is informative for even the most Metaphysics-averse.</b></font></b></p>

They discuss how we ought to axiomatise our mereology, whether we can reduce mereological relations to identity or to locative relations, whether Mereological Essentialism is true, different ways in which entities persist through space, time, spacetime, and even hypertime, conflicting intuitions we have about space, and what mereology and propositions can tell us about one another. The breadth and accessibility of the papers make this volume an excellent introduction for those not yet working on these topics.
