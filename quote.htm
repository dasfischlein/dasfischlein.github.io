<title>What But Metaphysics?</title>

<body background="quote_files/venusmoon3164.jpg" bgproperties="fixed">



<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;When all else is removed, nothing but Metaphysics remains&quot; is a ripoff from 

Aristotle's <i>Metaphysics</i> VII, and statements of this form are discussed in &quot;Mixtures&quot; by Richard Sharvy (1983<i>. Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</i> <b>44</b>: pp. 

227-239), who says &quot;much of this seems completely idle.&nbsp; For the schema 

'When all else is removed nothing but ----- remains' will hold regardless of 

what we put in the blank.&quot;&nbsp; Of course, as Ned Markosian has pointed 

out, we can think of cases in which the removal of 

everything except something, <i>x</i>, entails the removal of <i>x</i>.&nbsp; 

For instance, if we were to remove everything except a chair, we would remove 

all of the chair's proper parts, which would entail the removal of the chair, in 

which case nothing would remain.&nbsp; Not to say statements of the form above 

can be false, just sometimes a bit misleading . . .</font></p>



<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Another Aristotle Quote:</font></p>



<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Happiness then is co-extensive with 

this Contemplative Speculation, and in proportion as people have the act of 

Contemplation so far have they also the being happy, not incidentally, but in 

the way of Contemplative Speculation because it is in itself precious.</font></p>



<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#FFFFFF">So Happiness must be a kind of 

Contemplative Speculation; but since it is Man we are speaking of he will need 

likewise External Prosperity, because his Nature is not by itself sufficient for 

Speculation, but there must be health of body, and nourishment, and tendance of 

all kinds.&quot;&nbsp; Aristotle, <i>Ethics</i> X, VIII.</font></p>
