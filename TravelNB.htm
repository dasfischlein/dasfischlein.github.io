to New Brunswick, NJ:</font></b><p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Rutgers 
event you'll be attending will take place in New Brunswick, New Jersey.&nbsp; 
Here's some information on the variety of ways one can arrive here:</font><p>
<b>By Plane:</b><p>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you travel to New Jersey by plane, you 
should probably fly into
<a href="http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/airports/html/newarkliberty.html">
Newark Liberty International Airport</a> (1-800-247-7433), as it is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Airports_New_York_City_Map_Julius_Schorzman.png">
the closest</a> large airport to New Brunswick.&nbsp; One could instead fly to 
New York's
<a href="http://www.panynj.gov/aviation/jfkframe.HTM">LaGuardia International 
Airport</a> or
<a href="http://www.panynj.gov/aviation/jfkframe.HTM">John F. Kennedy 
International Airport</a>, or even to <a href="http://www2.sjta.com/acairport/">
Atlantic City International Airport</a> (1-609-645-7895) or
<a href="http://www.phl.org/">Philadelphia International Airport</a> 
(1-215-937-6937), but this will result in travel to New Brunswick being both 
more time-consuming and more expensive.</font><p>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you fly into EWR, then you will 
arrive in the A, B or C concourse.&nbsp; 
Here's a
<a href="http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/airports/html/ewr_maps.html">map 
of the airport</a>.&nbsp; To get around the airport, you will probably need to 
use the <a href="http://www.panynj.gov/airtrainnewark/">AirTrain</a>.&nbsp; 
There is no charge for it, and it is easy to find (there are signs for it 
throughout the airport).&nbsp; The AirTrain leaves every 3 minutes, except 
between midnight and 5:00am (7:00am on Sundays), when it leaves every 15 
minutes.&nbsp; Once at EWR, you'll have several options for getting to New 
Brunswick.</font><p>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">You can rent a car and drive to New 
Brunswick.&nbsp; The drive takes approximately 30-45 minutes.&nbsp; To get to 
the car rental companies:&nbsp; take the AirTrain to Station P3 for
<a href="http://www.avis.com/AvisWeb/home/AvisHome">Avis</a> (1-800-230-4898),
<a href="https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/index.jsp?targetPage=reservationOnHomepage.jsp">
Hertz</a> (1-800-654-3131) or <a href="http://www.nationalcar.com/">National</a> 
(1-800-CAR-RENT), or take it to Station P2 for
<a href="http://www.budget.com/budgetWeb/home/home.ex">Budget</a> 
(1-800-527-0700), <a href="http://www.dollar.com/">Dollar</a> (1-800-434-2226), 
or courtesy vehicles that'll take you to
<a href="http://www.enterprise.com/car_rental/home.do">Enterprise</a> 
(1-800-325-8007).</font><p>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">You can take a cab to New Brunswick, though 
it will cost roughly $40-$50 one way.</font><p>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">You can take a shuttle from Newark.&nbsp; 
Where the shuttle drops you off and what the fares are depends on which shuttle 
you use.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.goairporter.com/">The Airporter</a> 
(1-800-385-4000) costs $27 one-way, and will drop you off in East Brunswick.&nbsp; 
From there you can take a cab to downtown New Brunswick.&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.stateshuttle.com/">The State Shuttle</a> (1-800-427-3207) 
costs $34 one-way for already scheduled service, and $51 one-way for special 
service.</font><p>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">I recommend taking
<a href="http://www.njtransit.com/sf_tr.shtml">the train</a> to New Brunswick 
instead.&nbsp; To do this, take the AirTrain toward Station P4, but don't get 
off at that stop.&nbsp; Instead, wait until the last stop, which is the Newark 
Liberty International Airport Train Station.&nbsp; Once there, you can buy 
NJRail tickets to New Brunswick, costing $12 one-way.&nbsp; This will take you 
to the New Brunswick train station, in the middle of downtown New Brunswick.&nbsp; 
From there, if you need to, you can take a cab wherever you need to go; they 
pick up passengers right at the bottom of the steps that lead away from the 
front of the train platform.&nbsp; There is also a
<a href="http://gobble.rutgers.edu/campusbuses.shtml">free campus bus</a> that 
travels between the Rutgers campuses in the area, and can take you from the 
train station to the Philosophy department.&nbsp; (Schedule and route 
information can be obtained by visiting their website, or by calling 
732-932-7744.)</font><p>
<b>By Train or Bus:</b><p>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">You can also travel to New Brunswick 
exclusively by train.&nbsp; Which trains you use will depend on where you're 
travelling from.&nbsp; If you're travelling from New York City, you can take
<a href="http://www.njtransit.com/">NJ Transit</a> Northeast Corridor Line from 
Penn Station:&nbsp; it takes roughly an hour, and costs $9.50 one-way.&nbsp; You 
can use the NJRail to arrive from a variety of places; see
<a href="http://www.njtransit.com/sf_tr_schedules_map.jsp">this map</a> for more 
information and <a href="http://www.njtransit.com/sf_tr.shtml">this site</a> for 
scheduling info, or call NJ Transit at 1-800-772-2222.</font><p>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you're travelling a greater distance, you 
may instead want to use
<a href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/HomePage">
Amtrak</a> (1-800-USA-RAIL) to get here.&nbsp; If you use Amtrak, you may need 
to transfer to NJ Transit at some point; you can find information on

<b>By Car:</b><p>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">You can also drive here:&nbsp; By car, New 
Brunswick is 18 miles from Princeton, 25 miles from Newark, 36 miles from 
Trenton, 40 miles from NYC, 73 miles from Philadelphia, 95 miles from Atlantic 
City, 127 miles from Hartford, 142 miles from Baltimore, 153 miles from Albany, 
NY, 182 miles from Providence, 198 miles from Washington, DC, and 217 miles from 
Boston.&nbsp; (Info obtained

<font face="Times New Roman,Times">New Brunswick is accessible via Route 1, 
Route 18, Route 27 and Livingston Avenue.&nbsp; There are also l<a href="http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/commuter/trafficinfo/">ive 
traffic reports</a> for NJ online, along with information about some of our 
major roadways, including the <a href="http://www2.sjta.com/acexpressway/">

<font face="Times New Roman,Times">For driving directions, your best bet is to 
use <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/directions/main.adp?bCTsettings=1">MapQuest</a> 
or <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/dd">Yahoo</a>, entering in the specific 
address you'd like to go to.&nbsp; However, there are also driving directions 
available <a href="http://maps.rutgers.edu/directions/nb.aspx">here</a>.</font><p>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Also, as is mentioned on that website, 
parking is not easy to come by around the Rutgers campuses.&nbsp; However, 
contrary to what is suggested, I don't think you need to call the Parking and 
Transportation Services.&nbsp; If you are bringing a car and are concerned about 
parking (perhaps because, e.g., the site of the Rutgers event is not within 
walking distance of where you'll be staying), contact me about it.&nbsp; And of 
course, if you have questions about anything else, please feel free to email me 
about those things as well.</font><p>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">Also, if you have questions about the Rutgers 
campuses, you can contact
<a href="http://campusinfo.rutgers.edu/">Campus Information Services</a> through 
their website or by calling

New Brunswick Information:</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">
Where you'll stay during your time in New Brunswick will partly depend on why 
you're coming here.&nbsp; If you're visiting as a prospective student, you'll 
probably be staying with Rutgers graduate students.&nbsp; If you're coming for a 
conference, there may be an official conference hotel; if there is, we'll 
attempt to negotiate a special rate for conference attendees; any information on 
this will be posted below as it becomes available for each conference.</font><p>
<font face="Times New Roman">The <a href="http://www.hojonewbrunswick.com/">Howard Johnson Express</a> 
(Phone:&nbsp; 732-828-8000, Fax:&nbsp; 732-220-0314) is the official conference 
hotel for <a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~sjk362/MM.htm">Metaphysical 
Mayhem</a> in June of 2006.&nbsp; The hotel is
<a href="http://www.hojonewbrunswick.com/mapdirections/">located at</a> 26 Route 
1 North, which is right by the junction of Route 1 and Route 18.&nbsp; It is 
about a 3-minute drive from the Rutgers Philosophy department (though 
unfortunately, there isn't a walkable route between the hotel and the 
department).</font><p>
<font face="Times New Roman">The
<a href="http://newbrunswick.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/index.jsp">Hyatt Regency</a>, 
located at 2 Albany Street 
(732-873-1234, or 1-800-233-1234), is the official conference hotel for the 2006 
<a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~sjk362/MTL.htm">Mereology, 
Topology and Location conference</a> in October, 2006.&nbsp; They are offering a 
&quot;Rutgers rate&quot; to MTL conference participants and attendees, which is $153 for 
Friday night, and $109 for each of Saturday and Sunday night (for a room with 1 
king-sized bed, or 2 double beds, and not including taxes).&nbsp; To get the 
Rutgers rate, you'll need to show them an invitation to the conference; I can 
email these to anyone who's registered for the conference (i.e., anyone whose 
name appears on the
<a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~sjk362/MTLParticipants.dwt">Conference 
Participants</a> webpage), and I'll have printed copies available for you to 
pick up on the first day of presentations.&nbsp; The Hyatt is a 2 minute drive 
from the Philosophy department (if traffic is light), and there are walkable 
routes between the locations as well.&nbsp; For more information on where 
the MTL talks are and how to get there from the Hyatt, check out the <a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~sjk362/MTLSchedule.htm">MTL 
Schedule</a> page.</font><p>
<font face="Times New Roman">Though we don't have an official conference hotel for the January 2007 
<a href="http://homepages.nyu.edu/~sjk362/RR.htm">Rutgers Philosophy of 
Religion conference</a>, I suggest staying at
<a href="http://www.univinn.rutgers.edu/">the University Inn</a> 
(Phone:&nbsp; 732-932-9144, Fax:&nbsp; 732-932-6952, Email:&nbsp; univinn@rci.rutgers.edu)
<a href="http://univinn.rutgers.edu/directions.jsp">located at</a> 178 Ryders 
Lane, which is a very short walking distance of the Rutgers Philosophy 
department.&nbsp; (All of the RR talks will take place in the Philosophy 
Department seminar room, so this hotel is in a convenient location.)&nbsp; If you'll be travelling in for the conference 
and would like to stay at the University Inn, you should call 
as soon as possible to make your reservation.</font><p>
